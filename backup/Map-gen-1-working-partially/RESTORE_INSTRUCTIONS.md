# Map-gen-1-working-partially Restore Point

**Created:** $(Get-Date)

## Current State
- ✅ **Tilesheet rendering issue FIXED** - Using Group clipping approach instead of srcRect
- ✅ **Performance optimized** - Debug logging removed to eliminate console spam
- ✅ **Procedural generation working** - Platforms and decorations spawning correctly
- ⚠️ **Image loading warnings present** - useImage calls failing for grassy map
- ✅ **Core game functionality intact** - Movement, physics, health system working

## Files Included
- `PrefabNode.tsx` - Core rendering fix with Group clipping
- `GameScreen.tsx` - Optimized with debug logging removed
- `useVerticalProcGen.ts` - Procedural generation system
- `maps.ts` - Cell-based map system

## How to Restore
1. Copy these files back to their original locations:
   - `PrefabNode.tsx` → `src/render/PrefabNode.tsx`
   - `GameScreen.tsx` → `src/components/GameScreen.tsx`
   - `useVerticalProcGen.ts` → `src/systems/useVerticalProcGen.ts`
   - `maps.ts` → `src/content/maps.ts`

## Known Issues
- Image loading warnings: `[PrefabNode] No image loaded for map "grassy"`
- This suggests `useImage(def.image)` calls are failing
- Tiles are rendering but may appear as blank/transparent

## Next Steps for Troubleshooting
1. Investigate why `useImage(def.image)` is failing for grassy map
2. Check if image paths are correct in `MAPS.grassy.image`
3. Verify image files exist in assets folder
4. Consider reverting to shared image context if needed
