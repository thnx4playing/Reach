# RESTORE POINT: 20250831_221544

## Current Working Configuration
This backup contains the almost-working configuration with:
- ✅ Smooth movement (no more erratic bouncing)
- ✅ Visual knob smoothing (no more visual bouncing)
- ✅ PanResponder-based controls (no RNGH crashes)
- ✅ Jump button working with movement
- ✅ No more NSInternalInconsistencyException crashes

## Files Backed Up
- `src/input/CirclePad.tsx` - PanResponder-based movement pad with dual smoothing
- `src/input/JumpButton.tsx` - Pressable-based jump button
- `src/components/GameScreen.tsx` - Game screen with current control integration
- `App.tsx` - Root app component

## To Restore This Configuration
1. Copy files from this backup directory back to their original locations:
   ```powershell
   Copy-Item "backup/20250831_221544/CirclePad.tsx" "src/input/CirclePad.tsx"
   Copy-Item "backup/20250831_221544/JumpButton.tsx" "src/input/JumpButton.tsx"
   Copy-Item "backup/20250831_221544/GameScreen.tsx" "src/components/GameScreen.tsx"
   Copy-Item "backup/20250831_221544/App.tsx" "App.tsx"
   ```

2. Restart the development server

## What Was Working
- Movement was smooth and responsive
- Visual knob moved smoothly without bouncing
- Jump button worked reliably
- No crashes from touch registry issues
- Both controls could be used simultaneously

## Issues to Address
- Movement could be even smoother
- Multi-touch handling could be improved
- Better chording support needed
