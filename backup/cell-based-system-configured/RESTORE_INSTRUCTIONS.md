# Cell-Based System Configured - Restore Point

**Date Created:** September 9, 2025  
**Description:** Clean implementation of the new cell-based atlas system

## What's Included

This restore point contains the working cell-based system with:

### ✅ **Updated Files**
- `src/content/maps.ts` - New cell-based system with single JSON per map
- `src/render/PrefabNode.tsx` - Simplified rendering using cells and frames
- `assets/maps/grassy/grassy_prefabs.json` - Updated with floor-final prefab using cells
- `assets/maps/*/prefabs.json` - Placeholder files for all map types

### ✅ **Key Features**
- **Single JSON per map** - No more separate grid files
- **Cell-based rendering** - Prefabs reference cells in frames table
- **Graceful fallback** - Maps without frames can use rects
- **Fixed scaling** - Sprites scale properly, positions don't
- **Clean code** - Removed complex debugging and conditional logic

### ✅ **System Status**
- ✅ Import errors resolved
- ✅ Atlas rendering fixed (tiles show individual coordinates)
- ✅ Hooks errors eliminated
- ✅ Performance improved

## How to Restore

1. **Stop the development server** (Ctrl+C)
2. **Copy files back:**
   ```bash
   cp -r backup/cell-based-system-configured/src/* src/
   cp -r backup/cell-based-system-configured/assets/* assets/
   cp backup/cell-based-system-configured/package.json .
   cp backup/cell-based-system-configured/package-lock.json .
   cp backup/cell-based-system-configured/tsconfig.json .
   cp backup/cell-based-system-configured/babel.config.js .
   cp backup/cell-based-system-configured/metro.config.js .
   cp backup/cell-based-system-configured/app.json .
   ```
3. **Restart the development server:**
   ```bash
   npx expo start --clear
   ```

## What Was Fixed

### **Original Problem**
- Tiles showing entire tilesheet instead of individual coordinates
- React hooks errors causing crashes
- Complex debugging code cluttering the system

### **Solution Applied**
- Implemented cell-based atlas system
- Prefabs now reference cells in frames table
- Simplified rendering logic
- Removed conditional hook calls
- Added proper scaling

### **Result**
- Clean, stable rendering system
- Individual tile coordinates working correctly
- No more hooks errors
- Better performance and maintainability

## Notes

- This system uses `grassy_prefabs.json` which contains both frames and prefabs
- Other maps (dark, desert, dungeon, frozen) use placeholder prefab files
- The grassy map has full cell-based prefabs with proper frame references
- All collision and sizing helpers are preserved and working
