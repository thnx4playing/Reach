# Map-gen-2-working-partially Restore Instructions

## Backup Created: September 9, 2025

This backup contains the state after fixing infinite re-render loops and image loading issues.

## Files Included:
- `GameScreen.tsx` - Fixed physics, frame timing, collision detection, and camera logic
- `useVerticalProcGen.ts` - Fixed infinite loop by removing platforms from dependency array
- `PrefabNode.tsx` - Uses Group clipping approach + dual image loading (context + direct)
- `MapImageContext.tsx` - Fixed infinite re-render by memoizing context value
- `jump.ts` - Improved jump timing and double-jump prevention

## Key Fixes Applied:
1. **Infinite Re-render Loop (MapImageProvider)**: Fixed by wrapping context value in useMemo()
2. **Infinite Re-render Loop (useVerticalProcGen)**: Fixed by removing platforms from dependency array
3. **Image Loading Issues**: Updated PrefabNode to use MapImageProvider context first, with direct loading fallback
4. **Group Clipping**: Preserved the working Group with clip approach for tile rendering

## Current Status:
- ✅ Infinite re-render loops fixed
- ✅ Group clipping rendering working
- ⚠️ Still getting image loading warnings (but game is playable)
- ✅ Physics and procedural generation working

## To Restore:
1. Copy all files from this backup to their respective locations in src/
2. The game should run without infinite re-render errors
3. Images may still show warnings but should render correctly

## Notes:
- The Group clipping approach is preserved and working
- Image loading warnings persist but don't affect gameplay
- All core game mechanics (physics, jump, procedural generation) are functional
